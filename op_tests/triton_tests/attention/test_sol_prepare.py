"""
Sol-Attn routing/preprocessing: kernel ABI contract and torch.compile traceability.

sol_prepare must be traceable under torch.compile(fullgraph=True). That is a hard requirement
of the entrypoint design, not a nice-to-have: a caller compiling an attention layer around Sol-Attn
must be able to trace straight through the routing, rather than hiding it in an opaque custom op of
its own. Two properties are what make it possible, and both are tested here rather than assumed:

  1. every output shape is a function of the input SHAPES alone, never of the values;
  2. no host-side branch reads device data.

Both were previously violated by the same code: a `counts[-1].item()` read of a token count the host
already knew from the shapes, and an `if empty.any()` guard around an idempotent term. This suite
pins the replacements as EQUIVALENT, not merely traceable.

The ASM kernel is not involved; this is pure Torch/Triton preprocessing and runs on any GPU.
