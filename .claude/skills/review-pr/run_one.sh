# Headless review of one PR: fetch -> GLM worker -> GLM refuter -> gates -> collect.
# Lives in the review-pr skill dir and drives the rest of the skill (calls its fetch.sh and
# triage.py). Pure GLM on the box (claude-glm), no claude-mix. Publishing is a separate step
# (_publish.py); this script does not publish.
#
# This is the backend of the @aiter-bot review workflow, and can also be run by hand.
#
# ⚠️ Must run in a plain terminal / the runner, NOT inside an auto-mode Claude session — the
#    auto-mode classifier blocks a headless sub-agent launched with
#    --dangerously-skip-permissions as "Create Unsafe Agents". A runner is a plain shell.
#
# ⚠️ Cross-family strength: worker and refuter are both GLM (same family) here. The refuter's
#    value comes from being a different family (Opus) catching the GLM worker's mistakes. Pure
#    GLM is weaker adversarially; point REFUTER_CMD at Opus to restore the cross-family check.
