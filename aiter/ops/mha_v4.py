    a geometry and fall back, which is the shape the validation in mha_v4_packed() wants.

    Both filters are optional and both narrow what is being asked:

    operands is what mha_v4_operands() builds -- the three formats and their three scale modes,

    mode picks one of MHA_V4_BLOCK_SPARSE_MODES instead of answering for all of them. Left None
    the modes are intersected rather than unioned, since a caller shaping a mask has not yet chosen
    how to route it and a geometry is only safe when either mode can serve it. That intersection is
    only meaningful across whole modes, though: the modes need not agree on operands at a given
    geometry (MXFP6 Q/K with an FP8 V has a sorted-sparse row and no Sol-Attn one), so a caller

    """Launch non-causal MHA v4 over pre-quantized BSHD operands.

    Formats, packing, and scale modes select an explicit ASM row. Packed widths and
    nonstandard K layouts are validated before launch; output is BF16 BSHD.
    Pass the ragged LUT triple to select the sorted-sparse row; omit all three
    tensors for dense. The work table is built inside the sparse custom op.
    With ``return_lse`` the call returns ``(out, lse)``, where ``lse`` is FP32
    ``[batch, heads, Sq]`` holding ``ln(sum exp(s - max)) + max``. Only rows whose
    manifest lse column is 1 can write it; the launcher refuses the others.

    Adding the pooled triple (mean_k, mean_v, block_bitmap) on top of the LUT
    selects Sol-Attn instead, which corrects the blocks the LUT dropped rather
    than discarding them; aiter.ops.triton's sol_prepare() builds all six
    tensors from one mask. A row that selects nothing falls back to the
    pooled-only softmax over every block instead of to a zero tile.
    A block-granular operand also needs its pooled scale (mean_k_scale,
    mean_v_scale), which sol_prepare() returns for exactly the operands
    whose source scale could not survive pooling.

    block_tile names the (q_tile, kv_tile) geometry the LUT and pooled tensors
    were built for; it defaults to this call's own operands' geometry, since
    gfx950's rows no longer agree on the KV tile at a given Q tile. Pass 64x64
    to route at a 64-token block with a 64-row query tile as well, which costs
    throughput per token -- the same KV is re-read by four times as many query
    tiles -- and only pays off if the finer blocks drop enough attention mass.
    mha_v4_block_tiles() lists what the GPU has kernels for.

    kv_range_tokens > 0 makes Sol-Attn restart its softmax every that many keys
    within the one launch: each range gets its own running max and pooled
    correction, and the ranges merge by their log-sum-exp as a KV-split would,
    without re-reading Q or re-launching. It must be a multiple of 32 KV tiles
    and needs a row that declares kv_range; 0 is one range over the sequence.

    mean_k_var, the per-block population variance of K in mean_k's dtype, shape and
    block stride, adds the second-order term 0.5 * scale^2 * sum_d q_d^2 * var[d] to
    every pooled logit: the Gaussian estimate of a block's log-mean-exp rather than
    its Jensen lower bound q . mean_k. It needs a row that declares jensen; None is
    the uncorrected pass on the same code object. An int8 K takes it as e4m3, since
    an integer cannot hold it. A block-scaled (E8M0 1x32) K has no single unit for
    it, so there it is the dequantized variance quantized the way mean_k is, and
    mean_k_var_scale carries its scale in mean_k_scale's layout.

    sorted_dispatch orders Sol-Attn's workgroups by lut_count, heaviest first in a few
    coarse levels and raster order within each, so the query tiles that compute the most
    blocks exactly (a forced sink row, say) start first instead of trailing the grid.
    The output is identical either way. None sorts wherever the row declares sorted,
    False keeps raster order, True requires it.

    v_pack names V's layout within v_format, and mean_v's with it. An MXFP4 or MXFP6 V packed
    by quantize_v_mxfp4_fp6_p / quantize_v_mxfp6_fp6_p is AttentionPack.V_FOR_FP6_P; those
    rows take an FP6 P operand and serve LSE, ragged KV, KV ranges, the Jensen term and sorted
    dispatch in every block-sparse mode.

    Shift-invariance holds for *any* constant vector, not just the exact mean, so this estimates it

    over K is what made centering too expensive to keep before -- and a few thousand rows estimate
    the shared component to well under the accuracy it is worth removing.

    It is also not a win at every magnitude. The subtraction takes energy out of K's RMS but not
    out of its outliers, so a per-tensor scale (set by amax) gets relatively coarser. Below a

    """Quantize BF16 BSHD operands, route the blocks, and run non-causal Sol-Attn MHA v4.

    Sol-Attn (arXiv 2607.24027) computes the above-threshold KV blocks exactly and recovers the
    rest from pooled per-block K/V under the same online softmax, so dropping a block costs its
    higher-order terms rather than all of its mass. ``beta`` sets the threshold at
    ``mean_j(proxy) + beta * std_j(proxy)`` per query tile, so it selects a block *density* rather
    than a block count: larger beta keeps fewer blocks exact and leans harder on the correction.

    Unlike ``mha_v4(block_mask=...)`` the selection is not the caller's to pass, because routing
    has to see the quantized K that the kernel will read. Everything here is traceable, so this
    composes under torch.compile(fullgraph=True).

    Only recipes with a mode-2 manifest row are supported. The per-tensor and BF16 ones pool K/V in
    the source dtype and reuse the source descales. Every recipe with an MX V (MXFP4, MXFP6, f8f6,
    f6f4) runs the FP6-P rows. An MX operand's codes are not element addressable, so it is pooled
    from its BF16 input and quantized again with pooled scales of its own, and an MX Q/K routes on
    those BF16 means, which the packers' shared Q/K rotation leaves unchanged. f8f6's FP8 Q/K
    routes and pools on its codes, as the per-tensor recipes do.

    ``block_tile`` sets the routing and dispatch geometry, defaulting to the geometry this call's
    own operands dispatch at. A finer tile raises beta's resolution -- the threshold is per query
    tile, so a smaller block has less mass to hide behind -- at the cost of more work per token.
    BF16 and BF16/FP8 route on a 64-token block by default; FP8, BF16 and BF16/FP8 also have a
    64x64 row, which narrows the query tile too. Routing, pooling and the kernel all read it from
    here, so they cannot end up disagreeing.

    ``return_lse`` gives the log-sum-exp of the ONE softmax the exact and pooled branches share,
    so it counts the proxy columns too. That merges exactly: a ring merge adds numerators and
    denominators separately, and the proxy sits in both, so the cancellation that makes the
    single-rank output good survives the merge unchanged (measured to 1.6e-7 in fp32 against a
    single-rank run of the same problem).

    What does NOT survive a shard is the routing. The threshold above is taken over the blocks
    this call is shown, so a rank holding part of the KV normalizes against its own shard, and the
    merged result is Sol-Attn with a selection that depends on how the keys were split. Usually
    that is harmless or even generous -- a homogeneous shard clears the bar more often, costing
    exact work rather than accuracy -- but a rank whose blocks are uniformly relevant has almost no
    spread for beta to cut against, so it pools content it holds: a constructed case measured 0.68
    against exact attention on one rank and 0.50 split across two. Decide the routing globally if
    that matters; ``mha_v4(block_mask=...)`` takes a selection the caller owns.

    ``kv_range_tokens`` splits the softmax, not the routing: the kernel restarts its max and pooled
    correction every that many keys and merges the ranges by LSE, while the selection above stays
    global. See mha_v4_packed for the constraints; 0 is one range.

    ``sorted_dispatch`` starts the query tiles with the most exact blocks first; see
    mha_v4_packed. It changes only the order, never the output.
