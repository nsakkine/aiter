                    -inf, in either output. If False they are unspecified
    preshuffle:     bool. The cache is stored in dot-operand order (see
                    cache_format), which reads it straight into the matrix core.
                    If False it is read token-major and staged through LDS
    dynamic:        bool. Build the work schedule on the device, for a batch whose
                    sequences differ in length
    schedule:       [NUM_CTAS, 4], dtype int32, work descriptors from
                    build_schedule. Takes precedence over dynamic
    row_ends:        [B * NEXT_N], dtype int32, optional. Exclusive per-row key
                    bound, indexed like weights, defaulting to
                    context_lens[b] - NEXT_N + n + 1; pass it under compression
                    or context parallelism. build_schedule needs the same tensor.
                    Under gather it counts the row's valid candidate slots
    use_gather:     bool. Walk a candidate list rather than the context, so
                    output column j holds candidate slot j
    candidates:     [B * NEXT_N, K] int32 ranked block ids, resolved here, or
                    what build_candidate_gather returned, used as is. row_ends
                    is the per-row key bound for the first and the slot count
                    for the second
    block_scores:   [B * NEXT_N, ceil(max_model_len / candidate_block_size)],
                    dtype float32. Allocated here if absent. Blocks [0,
                    ceil(context_len / C)) are written, the tail past them is
                    not -- clean_logits decides what it reads as, exactly as it
                    does for the logits. The block holding each row's newest
                    key is pinned to +inf, so recent context is a candidate
                    whatever it scored
    calc_logits:    bool, default True
    calc_block_scores: bool, default False. With calc_logits off no
                    [B * NEXT_N, max_model_len] logits tensor is allocated or
                    written at all
    candidate_block_size: int, columns per candidate block. Must divide
                    BLOCK_KV so no block straddles a tile or a KV split

    Returns:
                    logits, or block_scores, or both as a pair -- whichever was
                    asked for

    About block scores:
    --------------------
    It has one consumer: pass 1 of the two-pass producer. No indexer layer can
    use it alone, because every layer needs its own top-k and that needs
    logits. The producer layer runs this, ranks the maxima into a candidate
    pool, and then runs a second `gather` launch over that pool to recover its
    own top-k.
