"""Fused Qwen3-Next Gated DeltaNet decode, with an optional FP8 quant epilogue.

One Gluon kernel launch replaces the four-kernel decode chain
``fused_qkvzba_split_reshape_cat -> causal_conv1d_update ->
fused_recurrent_gated_delta_rule_packed_decode -> layer_norm_gated`` and can
additionally emit the per-head group-128 FP8 activations that a block-FP8
``out_proj`` consumes directly, removing a separate quantization launch.

This is a *sibling* of :func:`fused_kda_decode`, not a variant of it. KDA uses a
per-channel lower-bounded sigmoid gate, a sigmoid output gate, uniform head
counts and no conv bias. Qwen3-Next GDN uses a per-head
``exp(-exp(A_log) * softplus(a + dt_bias))`` decay, a SiLU output gate,
``num_v_heads == 2 * num_k_heads`` and a biased convolution. The head topology
alone (KDA's ``lp = H*K`` offsets) cannot express ``VH == 2*KH``.

Support is deliberately narrow and is reported by
:func:`fused_gdn_decode_qkvz_supported` rather than asserted, so callers fall
back instead of crashing. gfx950 only: the kernels use CDNA buffer addressing,
hand-written ``v_exp_f32``/``v_rcp_f32`` inline asm and explicit register
layouts.
