"""FlyDSL causal-conv1d update host wrappers (decode + speculative verify).

One algorithm behind two upstream interfaces, both maintained:
``causal_conv1d_update_flydsl`` is a drop-in for vLLM's (and aiter's Triton)
``causal_conv1d_update``; ``causal_conv1d_update_sglang_flydsl`` is SGLang's,
which adds per-step ``intermediate_conv_window`` snapshots and an EAGLE tree
traversal. Both launch the same grid shape, so one tile/occupancy policy
(``_pick_block_n`` / ``_pick_cpt``) serves both.

Neither is selected by default; the in-tree seam in
``aiter.ops.triton.conv.causal_conv1d`` opts in via
``AITER_CONV1D_UPDATE_FLYDSL=1`` and keeps Triton for anything outside the
port's scope. The ``_..._supported`` predicates are private so that a caller
which gets the scope wrong hits a ``NotImplementedError`` instead of silently
mis-executing.

Warning: the two upstreams' skip sentinels differ in *value*, not just in name
-- vLLM's ``null_block_id`` is ``0`` (a valid index, since block 0 is reserved)
while SGLang's ``pad_slot_id`` is ``-1``. Mixing them up does not raise: under
``null_block_id=0``, ``conv_state_indices`` must start at 1 or sequence 0 is
silently skipped.
